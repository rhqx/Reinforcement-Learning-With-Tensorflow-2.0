**1. monte_carlo_methods.py**<br/> 
Policy gradients algorithms with monte carlo methods. All algorithms have a options to run train with a single agent or with multiple agents synchronously.<br/>  
**a) Vanillar policy gradients**<br/> 
**b) policy gradients with baseline**<br/>
**c)  Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**<br/>

 **2. temporal_difference_methods.py**<br/>
Policy gradients algorithms with temporal difference methods. These algorithms add bootstrapping feature to monte carlo methods, All algorithms have a options to run train with a single agent or with multiple agents synchronously.<br/>
