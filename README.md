**1. monte_carlo_methods.py**
Policy gradients algorithms with monte carlo methods. All algorithms have a options to run train with a single agent or with multiple agents synchronously.  
**a) Vanillar policy gradients**
**b) policy gradients with baseline**
**c)  Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**

 **2. temporal_difference_methods.py**
Policy gradients algorithms with temporal difference methods. These algorithms add bootstrapping feature to monte carlo methods, All algorithms have a options to run train with a single agent or with multiple agents synchronously.  
**a) TD Vanillar policy gradients**
**b) TD policy gradients with baseline （Actor-Critic）**
**c)  TD Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**
